# ðŸ§® HW-Assignment-5 â€” Loops Practice

### **Problem 1: Nested Loops**
Write a Python program that uses **nested loops** to print a 3Ã—3 grid of numbers, where each number is the product of the row and column indices (starting from 1).

**Example Output:**
```
1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
```

---

### **Problem 2: Pre-Test Loop (While Loop)**
Write a Python program that keeps asking the user to input a number between **10 and 20**.  
If the user enters a valid number, print `"Valid number!"` and exit the loop.  
If not, print `"Invalid number, try again."`

**Example Run:**
```
Enter a number between 10 and 20: 25
Invalid number, try again.
Enter a number between 10 and 20: 15
Valid number!
```

---

### **Problem 3: Summing Until Sentinel (While Loop)**
Write a Python program that repeatedly asks the user to enter **positive numbers**.  
The loop should stop when the user enters `0`.  
After the loop ends, display the **total sum** and the **count of numbers entered**.

**Example Run:**
```
Enter a number (0 to stop): 5
Enter a number (0 to stop): 10
Enter a number (0 to stop): 3
Enter a number (0 to stop): 0
You entered 3 numbers. Total sum = 18
```

---

### **Problem 4: Multiplication Table (For Loop)**
Write a Python program that asks the user for a number and prints its **multiplication table** up to 12 using a `for` loop.  
Each line should show the equation and the result.

**Example Run:**
```
Enter a number: 7
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
...
7 x 12 = 84
```
