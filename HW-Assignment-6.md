### Problem 4: Analyze Login Attempts
Write a Python program that initializes a list of login attempt results such as `["success", "fail", "fail", "success", "fail"]`. Use list comprehension to create a new list containing only the failed attempts. Print the count of failed attempts and the new list.

### Problem 5: Create and Modify a Cyber Threat Dictionary
Write a Python program that initializes a dictionary with the following key-value pairs representing threat levels: `{"malware": 3, "phishing": 4, "ransomware": 5}`. Add a new key-value pair `"ddos": 2`, update the value of `"phishing"` to `5`, and remove the key `"malware"`. Finally, print the updated dictionary.
