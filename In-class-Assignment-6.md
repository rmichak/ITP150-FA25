### Problem 1: Initialize and Traverse a List of Vulnerabilities
Write a Python program that initializes a list with the values `["SQL Injection", "Cross-Site Scripting", "Buffer Overflow", "Phishing", "Privilege Escalation"]`, then traverses the list and prints each vulnerability.

### Problem 2: Input Login Attempt IPs
Write a Python program that creates an empty list and then prompts the user to input 5 IP addresses representing login attempts. Append each to the list, then print the list of all login attempts.

### Problem 3: Simulate Password Hashing
Write a Python program that initializes a list with the values `["admin123", "letmein", "qwerty", "welcome", "password1"]`. Then, replace each password with `"*"` repeated for the length of the password (to simulate hashing) and print the modified list.
