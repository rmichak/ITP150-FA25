## ITP150 SUMMER 2025 Final EXAM ‚Äì Library Management System (Total: 100 Points)

### Objective:

Design a Library Management System using object-oriented programming in Python. Your program will manage books and users, allowing the addition, removal, update, and display of records.

You will implement two classes:

* `Book`
* `LibrarySystem`

Each class will have specific attributes and methods to simulate a basic book lending system.

---

### Class: `Book` (45 points)

#### **Attributes:**

* `book_id` ‚Äì Unique identifier for the book
* `title` ‚Äì Title of the book
* `author` ‚Äì Author's name
* `status` ‚Äì Whether the book is "available" or "checked out"
* `borrower` ‚Äì Name of borrower (if checked out)

#### **Methods:**

1. `__init__(self, book_id, title, author)`
   Initialize book attributes and set status to "available".

2. `checkout(self, borrower_name)`
   Change status to "checked out" and record borrower's name.

3. `return_book(self)`
   Change status to "available" and clear borrower info.

4. `update_info(self, title=None, author=None)`
   Update the title and/or author.

5. `display_info(self)`
   Print a formatted summary of the book.

---

### Class: `LibrarySystem` (45 points)

#### **Attributes:**

* `books` ‚Äì A dictionary with `book_id` as key and `Book` objects as values.

#### **Methods:**

1. `__init__(self)`
   Initialize the empty `books` dictionary.

2. `add_book(self, book_id, title, author)`
   Add a new book to the system.

3. `remove_book(self, book_id)`
   Remove a book from the system.

4. `update_book_info(self, book_id, title=None, author=None)`
   Update a book‚Äôs title or author.

5. `checkout_book(self, book_id, borrower_name)`
   Check out a book to a user.

6. `return_book(self, book_id)`
   Return a book to the library.

7. `display_book(self, book_id)`
   Display a single book‚Äôs information.

8. `display_all_books(self)`
   Display info for all books in the library.
