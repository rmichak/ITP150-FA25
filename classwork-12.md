### **Kali Linux: Managing Files and Folders**

This tutorial will guide you through basic file and folder management tasks using **Bash commands** and then show how to accomplish the same tasks using Pythonâ€™s `subprocess` module.

---

### **1. Creating a New File**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

To create a new file in the terminal, you can use the `touch` command.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  touch newfile.txt
  ```
- **Explanation**: This creates an empty file named `newfile.txt` in the current directory.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can achieve the same task by running the `touch` command from a Python script using the `subprocess` module.

```python
import subprocess

# Create a new file using touch command
subprocess.run(["touch", "newfile.txt"])
```

### **2. Writing Text to a File**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

To write text to a file, you can use the `echo` command with redirection (`>`).

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  echo "Hello, World!" > newfile.txt
  ```
- **Explanation**: This writes "Hello, World!" into `newfile.txt`. The `>` symbol overwrites the file content if the file already exists.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can run the same `echo` command in Python using `subprocess.run()`.

```python
import subprocess

# Write text to a file using echo command
subprocess.run('echo "Hello, World!" > newfile.txt', shell=True)
```

### **3. Creating a New Directory**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

To create a directory in the terminal, use the `mkdir` command.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  mkdir newfolder
  ```
- **Explanation**: This creates a new directory named `newfolder` in the current directory.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

To create a directory in Python, use the `mkdir` command with `subprocess`.

```python
import subprocess

# Create a new directory using mkdir command
subprocess.run(["mkdir", "newfolder"])
```

### **4. Moving a File into a Directory**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

To move a file to a directory, use the `mv` command.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  mv newfile.txt newfolder/
  ```
- **Explanation**: This moves `newfile.txt` into the `newfolder` directory.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

The same operation can be done in Python using `subprocess.run()`.

```python
import subprocess

# Move a file into a directory using mv command
subprocess.run(["mv", "newfile.txt", "newfolder/"])
```

### **5. Listing the Contents of a Directory**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

To list the contents of a directory, use the `ls` command.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ls newfolder
  ```
- **Explanation**: This lists the files and subdirectories inside the `newfolder` directory.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

In Python, you can list the contents of a directory using the `ls` command with `subprocess`.

```python
import subprocess

# List the contents of a directory using ls command
subprocess.run(["ls", "newfolder"])
```

### **6. Removing a File**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

To delete a file, use the `rm` command.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  rm newfolder/newfile.txt
  ```
- **Explanation**: This deletes `newfile.txt` from the `newfolder` directory.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can delete the file in Python by using the same `rm` command via `subprocess`.

```python
import subprocess

# Remove a file using rm command
subprocess.run(["rm", "newfolder/newfile.txt"])
```

### **7. Removing a Directory**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

To delete an empty directory, use the `rmdir` command.

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  rmdir newfolder
  ```
- **Explanation**: This removes the empty `newfolder` directory.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

To remove a directory using Python, you can run the `rmdir` command via `subprocess`.

```python
import subprocess

# Remove a directory using rmdir command
subprocess.run(["rmdir", "newfolder"])
```

### **Kali Linux: Package Management**

This tutorial covers basic package management tasks in **Kali Linux** using the **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**. We will first demonstrate these tasks using **Bash commands**, followed by the same tasks using Python's `apt` module. 

### **What is APT?**
APT is the package management system used in Debian-based Linux distributions (like Ubuntu and Kali Linux) to install, update, remove, and manage software packages.

---

### **1. Updating Package List**

Before installing or upgrading any package, it's essential to update the local package list so that the latest version of available software can be fetched.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```

- **Explanation**: This command updates the package list from the repositories, ensuring that you have the latest information on available packages.

#### **Using Python with `apt` Module:**

The `apt` module in Python provides a way to interact with APT. Here's how you can update the package list using Python:

```python
import apt

# Create an apt cache object
cache = apt.Cache()

# Update the package list
cache.update()

# Reopen the cache after the update
cache.open()
print("Package list updated successfully!")
```

---

### **2. Upgrading Installed Packages**

After updating the package list, you may want to upgrade all installed packages to their latest versions.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt upgrade
  ```

- **Explanation**: This command upgrades all installed packages to the newest available versions.

#### **Using Python with `apt` Module:**

You can upgrade packages using Python by iterating over the package cache and marking packages for upgrade.

```python
import apt

# Create an apt cache object
cache = apt.Cache()

# Update the cache and mark packages for upgrade
cache.update()
cache.open()

# Mark all packages for upgrade
cache.upgrade()

# Commit the changes (upgrade the packages)
cache.commit()
print("Packages upgraded successfully!")
```

---

### **3. Installing a New Package**

To install a new package, use the `apt install` command in Bash, or the equivalent Python code with the `apt` module.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nmap
  ```

- **Explanation**: This installs the `nmap` package, a popular network scanning tool, on your system.

#### **Using Python with `apt` Module:**

You can install packages using Python by marking them for installation.

```python
import apt

# Create an apt cache object
cache = apt.Cache()

# Open the cache
cache.open()

# Check if the package is available in the cache
if 'nmap' in cache:
    pkg = cache['nmap']
    if not pkg.is_installed:
        # Mark the package for installation
        pkg.mark_install()
        cache.commit()
        print("Nmap package installed successfully!")
    else:
        print("Nmap is already installed.")
else:
    print("Package 'nmap' not found.")
```

---

### **4. Removing a Package**

If you no longer need a package, you can remove it using `apt remove` in Bash or via Python.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt remove nmap
  ```

- **Explanation**: This removes the `nmap` package from your system, keeping its configuration files.

#### **Using Python with `apt` Module:**

To remove a package using Python:

```python
import apt

# Create an apt cache object
cache = apt.Cache()

# Open the cache
cache.open()

# Check if the package is installed
if 'nmap' in cache:
    pkg = cache['nmap']
    if pkg.is_installed:
        # Mark the package for removal
        pkg.mark_delete()
        cache.commit()
        print("Nmap package removed successfully!")
    else:
        print("Nmap is not installed.")
else:
    print("Package 'nmap' not found.")
```

---

### **5. Searching for a Package**

Sometimes, you might need to search for a package to check if it exists in the repository.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  apt search nmap
  ```

- **Explanation**: This searches the APT repositories for the `nmap` package and displays relevant information.

#### **Using Python with `apt` Module:**

To search for a package in Python, you can use the following approach:

```python
import apt

# Create an apt cache object
cache = apt.Cache()

# Open the cache
cache.open()

# Search for the package
if 'nmap' in cache:
    print("Package 'nmap' found in the repository.")
else:
    print("Package 'nmap' not found.")
```

---

### **6. Cleaning Up Unused Packages**

Over time, packages that are no longer required may accumulate on your system. You can remove them using the `autoremove` command.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt autoremove
  ```

- **Explanation**: This command removes packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer needed.

#### **Using Python with `apt` Module:**

You can automate this cleanup task in Python:

```python
import apt

# Create an apt cache object
cache = apt.Cache()

# Open the cache
cache.open()

# Perform autoremove
cache.clean()
print("Unused packages removed successfully!")
```

---

### **7. Getting Package Information**

To get detailed information about a package, you can use the `show` command in Bash or check the package object properties in Python.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  apt show nmap
  ```

- **Explanation**: This command displays detailed information about the `nmap` package, such as its version, description, and dependencies.

#### **Using Python with `apt` Module:**

To retrieve package information in Python:

```python
import apt

# Create an apt cache object
cache = apt.Cache()

# Open the cache
cache.open()

# Get package information
if 'nmap' in cache:
    pkg = cache['nmap']
    print(f"Package: {pkg.name}")
    print(f"Version: {pkg.installed.version if pkg.is_installed else 'Not installed'}")
    print(f"Description: {pkg.candidate.summary}")
else:
    print("Package 'nmap' not found.")
```

### **Kali Linux: Process Management**

Process management in Linux is a critical skill for system administration, helping you monitor, control, and manage running processes. In this tutorial, we will first demonstrate key process management tasks using **Bash commands**, and then replicate those tasks using **Python** with the `psutil` module, which is a Python library for system and process utilities.

---

### **1. Viewing Running Processes**

To view the running processes, you can use the `ps` command in the terminal or use the `psutil` module in Python.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ps aux
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command lists all running processes, showing information such as PID (Process ID), CPU usage, memory usage, user, and the command that started the process.

#### **Using Python with `psutil` Module:**

You can list the running processes in Python using the `psutil.process_iter()` function.

```python
import psutil

# List all running processes
for process in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name', 'username', 'cpu_percent', 'memory_percent']):
    print(process.info)
```

---

### **2. Finding a Process by Name**

Sometimes, you want to locate a process by name, like `python` or `nginx`.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep python
  ```

- **Explanation**: This filters the list of running processes to show only those containing the name "python".

#### **Using Python with `psutil` Module:**

You can search for a process by name using Python:

```python
import psutil

# Search for processes by name
for process in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name']):
    if 'python' in process.info['name']:
        print(f"Found process: {process.info}")
```

---

### **3. Viewing Detailed Information About a Process**

You can view detailed information such as CPU usage, memory usage, and more for a specific process by its PID (Process ID).

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ps -p <PID> -o pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu
  ```

- **Explanation**: This command shows detailed information about the process with the given `PID`.

#### **Using Python with `psutil` Module:**

You can retrieve process information in Python using the PID:

```python
import psutil

# Example PID (replace with actual PID)
pid = 1234

try:
    process = psutil.Process(pid)
    print(f"Process ID: {process.pid}")
    print(f"Parent Process ID: {process.ppid()}")
    print(f"Command: {process.cmdline()}")
    print(f"CPU Usage: {process.cpu_percent()}%")
    print(f"Memory Usage: {process.memory_percent()}%")
except psutil.NoSuchProcess:
    print(f"No process found with PID {pid}")
```

---

### **4. Killing (Terminating) a Process**

You can terminate or kill a running process by its PID.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  kill <PID>
  ```

- **Explanation**: This sends a termination signal to the process identified by `PID`.

#### **Using Python with `psutil` Module:**

You can kill a process in Python as follows:

```python
import psutil

# Example PID (replace with actual PID)
pid = 1234

try:
    process = psutil.Process(pid)
    process.terminate()  # Send terminate signal
    process.wait(timeout=5)
    print(f"Process {pid} terminated successfully.")
except psutil.NoSuchProcess:
    print(f"No process found with PID {pid}")
except psutil.TimeoutExpired:
    print(f"Failed to terminate process {pid} within the timeout period.")
```

---

### **5. Monitoring System Resource Usage (CPU, Memory)**

You can monitor the overall CPU and memory usage on the system.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  top
  ```

- **Explanation**: `top` provides a real-time, interactive view of system resource usage, including CPU and memory.

#### **Using Python with `psutil` Module:**

In Python, you can monitor system resource usage as follows:

```python
import psutil

# Get system-wide CPU usage
cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)
print(f"CPU Usage: {cpu_usage}%")

# Get system-wide memory usage
memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()
print(f"Memory Usage: {memory_info.percent}%")
```

---

### **6. Listing the Process Tree (Parent-Child Relationships)**

Sometimes, you may want to see the parent-child relationships between processes.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  pstree
  ```

- **Explanation**: This displays a tree view of processes, showing their parent-child relationships.

#### **Using Python with `psutil` Module:**

To show the parent-child relationship in Python:

```python
import psutil

def print_process_tree(pid, indent=0):
    try:
        process = psutil.Process(pid)
        print(" " * indent + f"{process.pid} - {process.name()}")
        for child in process.children():
            print_process_tree(child.pid, indent + 4)
    except psutil.NoSuchProcess:
        pass

# Example PID (replace with actual PID)
pid = 1  # Usually PID 1 is the init/systemd process
print_process_tree(pid)
```

---

### **7. Changing the Priority (Nice Value) of a Process**

You can change the priority of a running process to make it run slower or faster.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  renice -n 10 -p <PID>
  ```

- **Explanation**: This sets the nice value of the process with `PID` to 10 (lower priority).

#### **Using Python with `psutil` Module:**

You can change the nice value (priority) in Python as follows:

```python
import psutil

# Example PID (replace with actual PID)
pid = 1234

try:
    process = psutil.Process(pid)
    process.nice(10)  # Set the nice value to 10
    print(f"Changed priority of process {pid} to {process.nice()}")
except psutil.NoSuchProcess:
    print(f"No process found with PID {pid}")
```

---

### **8. Running a Command in the Background**

You can start a new process and run it in the background.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  command &
  ```

- **Explanation**: This starts `command` in the background.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess` Module**:

In Python, you can start a new background process using the `subprocess` module.

```python
import subprocess

# Run a command in the background
subprocess.Popen(["sleep", "10"])  # This command sleeps for 10 seconds in the background
print("Process started in the background.")
```

---

### **Kali Linux: User and Group Management**

Managing users and groups is a critical task for any system administrator in Linux. In this tutorial, we'll go over the basics of **user and group management** in Kali Linux using **Bash commands** and then show how to automate these tasks using **Python**.

Python's `subprocess` module will be used to execute the user and group management tasks because, unlike `psutil`, there is no direct Python module for managing users and groups. Instead, Python will execute the same Bash commands to automate these tasks.

---

### **1. Creating a New User**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo adduser newuser
  ```

- **Explanation**: This creates a new user named `newuser` on the system. It prompts for a password and other optional details (name, room number, etc.).

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can create a new user by running the same `adduser` command using Pythonâ€™s `subprocess` module.

```python
import subprocess

# Create a new user using adduser command
subprocess.run(["sudo", "adduser", "newuser"])
```

---

### **2. Deleting a User**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo deluser newuser
  ```

- **Explanation**: This removes the user `newuser` from the system but retains their home directory and files unless you specify otherwise.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can remove a user in Python by running the `deluser` command.

```python
import subprocess

# Delete a user using deluser command
subprocess.run(["sudo", "deluser", "newuser"])
```

---

### **3. Adding a User to a Group**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG groupname newuser
  ```

- **Explanation**: This adds `newuser` to the specified group (`groupname`). The `-aG` option appends the user to the group without removing them from other groups.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can add a user to a group using Pythonâ€™s `subprocess` module as follows:

```python
import subprocess

# Add a user to a group using usermod command
subprocess.run(["sudo", "usermod", "-aG", "groupname", "newuser"])
```

---

### **4. Creating a New Group**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo addgroup newgroup
  ```

- **Explanation**: This creates a new group named `newgroup` on the system.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can create a new group in Python by running the `addgroup` command.

```python
import subprocess

# Create a new group using addgroup command
subprocess.run(["sudo", "addgroup", "newgroup"])
```

---

### **5. Deleting a Group**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo delgroup newgroup
  ```

- **Explanation**: This removes the group `newgroup` from the system.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can delete a group using the `delgroup` command in Python.

```python
import subprocess

# Delete a group using delgroup command
subprocess.run(["sudo", "delgroup", "newgroup"])
```

---

### **6. Changing a User's Password**

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo passwd newuser
  ```

- **Explanation**: This changes the password for the user `newuser`. You will be prompted to enter and confirm the new password.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

To change a user's password, you can use `subprocess` to call the `passwd` command.

```python
import subprocess

# Change the password for a user using passwd command
subprocess.run(["sudo", "passwd", "newuser"])
```

---

### **7. Locking and Unlocking a User Account**

#### **Locking a User Account in Bash**:

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -L newuser
  ```

- **Explanation**: This locks the user `newuser` account, preventing them from logging in.

#### **Unlocking a User Account in Bash**:

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -U newuser

### **Kali Linux: Networking**

Networking is a fundamental part of Linux administration, and it's particularly important for tasks like configuring network interfaces, testing connectivity, and managing network services. In this tutorial, we will go through some basic **networking tasks** in Kali Linux using **Bash commands** and then replicate those tasks using **Python** with modules like `subprocess`, `socket`, and `scapy` (for more advanced networking tasks).

---

### **1. Checking Your Network Interface Configuration**

The `ifconfig` command allows you to view the configuration of your network interfaces.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```

- **Explanation**: This displays detailed information about all the active network interfaces, including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and packet statistics.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can run the `ifconfig` command using Pythonâ€™s `subprocess` module to get the same output.

```python
import subprocess

# Run the ifconfig command to check network interfaces
subprocess.run(["ifconfig"])
```

---

### **2. Checking Connectivity with Ping**

The `ping` command is used to check whether a remote system is reachable.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ping -c 4 google.com
  ```

- **Explanation**: This sends 4 ICMP echo request packets to `google.com` and displays the response time, showing whether the host is reachable.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can ping a host from Python by running the `ping` command with `subprocess`.

```python
import subprocess

# Run the ping command to check connectivity
subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "4", "google.com"])
```

---

### **3. Checking Your IP Address**

To check your system's IP address, you can use the `ip` command or `ifconfig`.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ip addr show
  ```

- **Explanation**: This shows your systemâ€™s IP address and other network interface details.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can run the `ip` command using Python as follows:

```python
import subprocess

# Run the ip command to check the IP address
subprocess.run(["ip", "addr", "show"])
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `socket` module to get your local IP address.

```python
import socket

# Get the local machine's IP address
hostname = socket.gethostname()
ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)
print(f"IP Address: {ip_address}")
```

---

### **4. Checking Open Ports on a System**

The `netstat` command (or `ss` in modern Linux distributions) allows you to check for open ports and active network connections.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  netstat -tuln
  ```

- **Explanation**: This shows all listening TCP and UDP ports with the `-tuln` options.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can check open ports in Python by running the `netstat` command.

```python
import subprocess

# Run the netstat command to check open ports
subprocess.run(["netstat", "-tuln"])
```

Alternatively, using the `socket` module, you can check if specific ports are open on the local machine.

```python
import socket

def check_port_open(port):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        result = s.connect_ex(('localhost', port))
        if result == 0:
            print(f"Port {port} is open")
        else:
            print(f"Port {port} is closed")

# Example: Check if port 80 (HTTP) is open
check_port_open(80)
```

---

### **5. Network Scanning with Nmap**

You can use `nmap` to scan a network for open ports and services.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Command**:
  ```bash
  nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
  ```

- **Explanation**: This scans the local network (192.168.1.0/24) to find active hosts.

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can call the `nmap` command from Python to run the same scan.

```python
import subprocess

# Run an nmap network scan
subprocess.run(["nmap", "-sP", "192.168.1.0/24"])
```

For a more Pythonic solution, you can use the `python-nmap` library to perform network scans programmatically.

```python
import nmap

# Initialize the nmap scanner
nm = nmap.PortScanner()

# Scan the network for active hosts
nm.scan('192.168.1.0/24', arguments='-sP')

# Display the results
for host in nm.all_hosts():
    print(f"Host {host} is {'up' if nm[host].state() == 'up' else 'down'}")
```

Make sure to install the `python-nmap` library if you're using this approach:
```bash
pip install python-nmap
```

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can execute the `traceroute` command using `subprocess` in Python.

```python
import subprocess

# Run traceroute to a host
subprocess.run(["traceroute", "google.com"])
```

---

### **7. Creating a Simple Network Packet (Advanced)**

For advanced network tasks such as crafting network packets, you can use Pythonâ€™s `scapy` module, which is a powerful tool for packet manipulation.

#### **Using Scapy in Python**:

You can create and send a simple ICMP (ping) packet using `scapy`.

```python
from scapy.all import ICMP, IP, sr1

# Create an ICMP packet
packet = IP(dst="google.com") / ICMP()

# Send the packet and wait for a response
response = sr1(packet, timeout=2)

# Print the response details
if response:
    response.show()
else:
    print("No response received")
```

Make sure to install `scapy` before running this code:
```bash
pip install scapy
```

---

### **8. Network Interface Configuration**

You can bring network interfaces up or down using the `ip` or `ifconfig` commands.

#### **Using Bash Commands:**

- **Bring an Interface Up**:
  ```bash
  sudo ifconfig eth0 up
  ```

- **Bring an Interface Down**:
  ```bash
  sudo ifconfig eth0 down
  ```

#### **Using Python with `subprocess`:**

You can automate enabling and disabling network interfaces using `subprocess` in Python.

```python
import subprocess

# Bring the eth0 interface up
subprocess.run(["sudo", "ifconfig", "eth0", "up"])

# Bring the eth0 interface down
subprocess.run(["sudo", "ifconfig", "eth0", "down"])
```
